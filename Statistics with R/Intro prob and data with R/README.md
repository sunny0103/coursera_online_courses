# Introduction probability and data with R course assignment
## Research questions: (11 points) Come up with at least three research questions that you want to answer using these data.
You should phrase your research questions in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. 
Make sure that at least two of these questions involve at least three variables. You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. 
With each question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.

## EDA: (30 points) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses each of the three research questions you outlined above.
Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
